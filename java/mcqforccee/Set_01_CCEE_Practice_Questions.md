---

### Question 2
**Correct Answer: B) .class**

**Explanation:** When Java source code (.java) is compiled, it produces bytecode stored in .class files. These are executed by the JVM.

---

### Question 3
**Correct Answer: C) String**

**Explanation:** String is a reference type (class), not a primitive. Java has 8 primitives: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean.

---

### Question 4
**Correct Answer: B) 4 bytes**

**Explanation:** In Java, `int` is always 4 bytes (32 bits) regardless of the system. Java has fixed-size data types for platform independence.

---

### Question 5
**Correct Answer: C) class**

**Explanation:** The `class` keyword is used to define a class in Java. Example: `class MyClass { }`

---

### Question 6
**Correct Answer: B) `MyClass obj = new MyClass();`**

**Explanation:** The `new` keyword creates a new object by calling the constructor. This allocates memory and initializes the object.

---

### Question 7
**Correct Answer: C) `main()`**

**Explanation:** The `main()` method is the entry point of any Java application. Its signature: `public static void main(String[] args)`

---

### Question 8
**Correct Answer: B) Java Virtual Machine**

**Explanation:** JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine that executes Java bytecode. It provides platform independence.

---

### Question 9
**Correct Answer: B) `+`**

**Explanation:** The `+` operator is used for string concatenation in Java. Example: `"Hello" + " World"` gives `"Hello World"`.

---

### Question 10
**Correct Answer: B) 0**

**Explanation:** Instance variables of numeric types default to 0. boolean defaults to false, and object references default to null.

---

### Question 11
**Correct Answer: B) extends**

**Explanation:** The `extends` keyword is used for inheritance. Example: `class Child extends Parent { }`

---

### Question 12
**Correct Answer: A) Hiding data using private access modifier**

**Explanation:** Encapsulation is bundling data and methods, restricting direct access to data using private modifiers and providing getters/setters.

---

### Question 13
**Correct Answer: C) `System.out.println("Hello");`**

**Explanation:** `System.out.println()` is the standard way to print to console in Java. System is a class, out is a static field, println is a method.

---

### Question 14
**Correct Answer: C) do-while**

**Explanation:** The do-while loop executes the body first, then checks the condition. This guarantees at least one execution.

---

### Question 15
**Correct Answer: B) `// comment`**

**Explanation:** `//` starts a single-line comment. Multi-line comments use `/* */`. Documentation comments use `/** */`.

---

### Question 16
**Correct Answer: C) private**

**Explanation:** `private` access modifier restricts access to the same class only. It's the most restrictive access level.

---

### Question 17
**Correct Answer: A) One class having multiple methods with same name but different parameters**

**Explanation:** Polymorphism means "many forms". Method overloading (compile-time polymorphism) allows methods with same name but different parameters.

---

### Question 18
**Correct Answer: B) final**

**Explanation:** The `final` keyword makes a variable constant - its value cannot be changed after initialization.

---

### Question 19
**Correct Answer: B) A special method used to initialize objects**

**Explanation:** Constructor is a special method called when an object is created. It has the same name as the class and no return type.

---

### Question 20
**Correct Answer: C) HashMap**

**Explanation:** HashMap stores data in key-value pairs. ArrayList and LinkedList store sequential elements, HashSet stores unique elements.

---

### Question 21
**Correct Answer: B) Object**

**Explanation:** The Object class is the root of the class hierarchy. Every class in Java implicitly inherits from Object.

---

### Question 22
**Correct Answer: B) break**

**Explanation:** The `break` statement exits the current loop or switch statement. `continue` skips to the next iteration.

---

### Question 23
**Correct Answer: A) Object Oriented Programming**

**Explanation:** OOP is a programming paradigm based on objects containing data and methods. Key principles: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction.

---

### Question 24
**Correct Answer: A) interface**

**Explanation:** The `interface` keyword defines an interface. Example: `interface MyInterface { void method(); }`

---

### Question 25
**Correct Answer: B) A collection of similar type elements**

**Explanation:** An array is a container that holds a fixed number of elements of the same data type, accessed by index.

---

### Question 26
**Correct Answer: B) try**

**Explanation:** The `try` block contains code that might throw an exception. It's followed by `catch` to handle the exception.

---

### Question 27
**Correct Answer: A) `int arr[];`**

**Explanation:** Both `int arr[]` and `int[] arr` are valid array declarations in Java. The second form is more common.

---

### Question 28
**Correct Answer: B) `length()`**

**Explanation:** The `length()` method returns the number of characters in a String. For arrays, use `length` property (no parentheses).

---

### Question 29
**Correct Answer: B) Multiple methods with same name but different parameters**

**Explanation:** Method overloading is compile-time polymorphism where methods have the same name but different parameter lists.

---

### Question 30
**Correct Answer: B) boolean**

**Explanation:** The `boolean` data type can only hold `true` or `false` values. It uses 1 bit conceptually.

---

### Question 31
**Correct Answer: B) Refers to current object**

**Explanation:** The `this` keyword refers to the current object instance. Used to distinguish instance variables from parameters.

---

### Question 32
**Correct Answer: B) implements**

**Explanation:** The `implements` keyword is used when a class implements an interface. Example: `class MyClass implements MyInterface`

---

### Question 33
**Correct Answer: B) A group of related classes and interfaces**

**Explanation:** A package organizes related classes and interfaces. It provides namespace management and access control.

---

### Question 34
**Correct Answer: B) `==`**

**Explanation:** The `==` operator compares values (primitives) or references (objects). `=` is assignment, `!=` is not equal.

---

### Question 35
**Correct Answer: B) Member belongs to class rather than instance**

**Explanation:** Static members belong to the class itself, not to individual objects. They're shared across all instances.

---

### Question 36
**Correct Answer: B) `toLowerCase()`**

**Explanation:** The `toLowerCase()` method returns a new String with all characters converted to lowercase.

---

### Question 37
**Correct Answer: B) A class acquiring properties of another class**

---

### Question 38
**Correct Answer: B) ArithmeticException**

**Explanation:** `ArithmeticException` is thrown when dividing integer by zero. Note: Floating-point division by zero returns Infinity.

---

### Question 39
**Correct Answer: A) `String s = "Hello";`**

**Explanation:** Strings can be created using string literals. `String` (capital S) is the class name. Quotes are required.

---

### Question 40
**Correct Answer: B) super**

**Explanation:** The `super` keyword refers to the parent class. Used to call parent constructor or access parent members.

---

### Question 41
**Correct Answer: B) Hiding complex implementation and showing only necessary features**

**Explanation:** Abstraction focuses on what an object does rather than how. Achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.

---

### Question 42
**Correct Answer: C) HashSet**

**Explanation:** HashSet implements the Set interface which doesn't allow duplicate elements. Lists allow duplicates.

---

### Question 43
**Correct Answer: B) Returns nothing**

**Explanation:** The `void` keyword indicates that a method doesn't return any value.

---

### Question 44
**Correct Answer: C) for**

**Explanation:** The `for` loop is ideal when the number of iterations is known in advance. It has initialization, condition, and update.

---

### Question 45
**Correct Answer: B) A lightweight subprocess**

**Explanation:** A thread is a lightweight unit of execution within a process. Multiple threads share the same memory space.

---

### Question 46
**Correct Answer: C) final**
