## EASY MCQs

### Q1. What does MSIL stand for in the context of .NET?

A. Microsoft Standard Intermediate Language  
B. Microsoft Source Integrated Language  
C. Microsoft Intermediate Language  
D. Machine Standard Interface Language  

<details>
<summary><strong>Answer</strong></summary>

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**  
MSIL stands for Microsoft Intermediate Language. It is the pseudocode generated by the C# compiler, similar to Byte Code in Java.
</details>

### Q2. Which component of the .NET Framework is responsible for managing the execution of code?

A. FCL (Framework Class Library)  
B. CLR (Common Language Runtime)  
C. CTS (Common Type System)  
D. JIT (Just-In-Time Compiler)  

<details>
<summary><strong>Answer</strong></summary>

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**  
The Common Language Runtime (CLR) manages the execution of .NET code, providing services like memory management and security.
</details>

### Q3. What is the file extension for a C# source code file?

A. .cs  
B. .csharp  
C. .net  
D. .cpp  

<details>
<summary><strong>Answer</strong></summary>

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**  
All C# source code files must have the `.cs` extension.
</details>

### Q4. Which .NET component is primarily used for developing Web Applications?

A. Windows Forms  
B. WPF  
C. ASP.NET  
D. ADO.NET  

<details>
<summary><strong>Answer</strong></summary>

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**  
ASP.NET is the component of the Framework Class Library designed for Web Application development.

## MEDIUM MCQs

### Q5. What is the correct sequence of the .NET program execution flow?

A. Source Code -> JIT Compiler -> CLR -> Native Code  
B. Source Code -> C# Compiler -> Native Code -> CLR  
C. Source Code -> C# Compiler -> MSIL -> CLR (JIT) -> Native Code  
D. Source Code -> MSIL -> C# Compiler -> Native Code  

<details>
<summary><strong>Answer</strong></summary>

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**  
The C# source code is compiled by `csc.exe` into MSIL. Then, the CLR loads the assembly, and the JIT compiler converts MSIL to Native Code at runtime.
</details>

### Q6. Which of the following statements is TRUE regarding the JIT Compiler?

A. It compiles the entire program to native code before execution starts.  
B. It converts MSIL to native code on demand, compiling only called functions.  
C. It converts native code back to MSIL for debugging.  
D. It is not responsible for caching compiled code.  

<details>
<summary><strong>Answer</strong></summary>

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**  
JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation works on demand. It converts MSIL to native code only for the functions that are called, and caches them for reuse.
</details>

### Q7. What distinguishes Managed Code from Unmanaged Code?

A. Managed Code runs directly on the OS, while Unmanaged Code runs under CLR.  
B. Managed Code is always written in C++, while Unmanaged Code is in C#.  
C. Managed Code executes under the control of CLR, utilizing garbage collection and type safety.  
D. Managed Code does not support cross-language interoperability.  

<details>
<summary><strong>Answer</strong></summary>

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**  
Managed Code is executed under the control of the CLR and benefits from services like modern memory management (garbage collection) and better security.
</details>

### Q8. In the .NET memory model, where are Reference Types (like objects and strings) stored?

A. Stack  
B. Heap  
C. CPU Registers  
D. GAC  

<details>
<summary><strong>Answer</strong></summary>

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**  
In the .NET memory model, Reference types (objects, strings, arrays) are stored in the Heap, while Value types (int, float) are stored on the Stack.
</details>

## HARD MCQs

### Q9. What is the specific role of `_CorExeMain` in the execution process tailored by the OS?

A. It compiles the C# code into MSIL.  
B. It acts as the entry point stub that initializes the CLR and locates the managed entry point.  
C. It is the main method of the user's program.  
D. It manages the Windows Forms UI rendering.  

<details>
<summary><strong>Answer</strong></summary>

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**  
When the OS loads the PE file, it jumps to `_CorExeMain` (imported from `mscoree.dll`), which initializes the CLR, locates the managed entry point, and begins execution.
</details>

### Q10. Which of the following is NOT a valid signature for the Main method in C#?

A. `static void Main()`  
B. `public static int Main(String[] args)`  
C. `public void Main()`  
D. `private static void Main()`  

<details>
<summary><strong>Answer</strong></summary>

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**  
The Main method MUST be `static`. `public void Main()` is missing the `static` keyword, so it is not a valid entry point.
</details>

### Q11. What information does the Assembly Manifest contain?

A. Only the MSIL code.  
B. Data types and identifiers used in the code.  
C. Assembly version, Culture info, and Metadata about types.  
D. The source code of the program in C#.  

<details>
<summary><strong>Answer</strong></summary>

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**  
The Manifest contains the Assembly version, Culture information (localization), and Metadata (type information for the project).
</details>

### Q12. Regarding the Stack and Heap memory model, which of the following is correct?

A. Stack memory is garbage collected, while Heap memory is cleaned up when the method returns.  
B. Value types are always allocated on the Heap.  
C. Stack allocation is faster and has a LIFO structure, while Heap allocation is dynamic and garbage collected.  
D. Local variables of Reference types are stored entirely on the Stack.  

<details>
<summary><strong>Answer</strong></summary>

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**  
The Stack uses a LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) structure and allows for fast allocation of value types. The Heap is used for dynamic allocation of reference types and is managed by the Garbage Collector.
